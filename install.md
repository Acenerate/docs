# Installing Kubecost

The recommended way to install the Kubecost product is to follow the Helm install instructions available at [kubecost.com/install](http://kubecost.com/install).

Alternatively, you can also install via flat manifest [here](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/README.md#manifest), but this provides less flexiblity for managing your deployment and has several product limitations.
