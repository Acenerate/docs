# Installing Kubecost

* The recommended way to install the Kubecost product is to follow the Helm install instructions available at [kubecost.com/install](http://kubecost.com/install). The provides the most flexibility for managing Kubecost and its dependencies. 

* Alternatively, you can install via [flat manifest](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/blob/master/README.md#manifest), but this install path provides less flexiblity for managing your deployment and has several product limitations.
  
* Lastly, you can deploy the open source, cost model engine directly as a pod. This install path provides a subset of Kubecost functionality and is available [here](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-model/blob/master/deploying-as-a-pod.md).
