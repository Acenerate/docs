# Capture a bug report

The Kubecost bug report feature captures relevent product configuration data and logs to debug an outstanding issue. 
To capture a bug report: visit __Settings__, scroll to the bottom, and select __CAPTURE BUG REPORT__.

We recommend sharing a bug report directly with our team and not distributing broadly becuase log data is included. 

__Note:__ the bug report feature requires namespace logs access, which is granted by default in Kubecost v1.51.2.
