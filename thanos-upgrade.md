If you're upgrading to kubecost 1.67.0 from kubecost < 1.67.0 and using thanos, you'll need to make a small change to your thanos secret in order to bump the thanos version to 0.15.0 before you upgrade kubecost.
Thanos 0.15.0 has over 10x performance improvements, so this is well worth the effort.

Your values-thanos.yaml needs to be updated to the new defaults: https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart/commit/752b584a520f2ff089517341ab2eca2664980dab#diff-b5f07a55b9483e6b0fc339c7a03fa08b .
The PR bumps the image version, adds the queryFrontend component, and increases concurrency.

This is simplified if you're using our default values-thanos.yaml -- that has the new configs already.

However, for the thanos secret you're using, the "encrypt-sse" line needs to be removed. Everything else should stay the same. For example:
```
config:
  bucket: ${bucket_name}
  endpoint: "s3.amazonaws.com"
  region: ${your_bucket_region}
  access_key: ${your_access_key}
  insecure: false
  signature_version2: false
  #encrypt_sse: false <--- comment this line out
  secret_key: ${your_secret_here}
  put_user_metadata:
      "X-Amz-Acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
  http_config:
    idle_conn_timeout: 90s
    response_header_timeout: 2m
    insecure_skip_verify: false
  trace:
    enable: true
  part_size: 134217728
```

The easiest way to do this is to delete the existing secret and upload a new one:

`kubectl delete secret -n kubecost kubecost-thanos`

update your secret yaml file as above, and save it as object-store.yaml

`kubectl create secret generic kubecost-thanos -n kubecost --from-file=./object-store.yaml`

Once this is done, you're ready to upgrade!
