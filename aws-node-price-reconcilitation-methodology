# AWS Node Price Reconciliation Methodology

Kubecost is capable of accurately grouping the costs of compute resources over a given timeframe with a specified duration step size. To achieve this, Kubecost uses Athena queries to gather data points with differing price models and filters out those that are not relevant. The result of this process is a resource id or provider id of a resource associated with a cost.

## Athena Queries

The reconciliation process makes two queries to Athena, one to gather resources that are paid for with either the on-demand model or a savings plan and one query for resources on the reservation model. The First query includes resources given at a blended rate, which could be on-demand usage or resources that have exceeded the limits of a savings plan. It will also include resourses which are part of a savings plan which will have a savings plan effective cost. 

The Queries will be made on the folloing fields:

- `line_item_usage_start_date` The beginning timestamp of the line item usage. Used to filter resource usage within a date range and to aggregate on usage window.

- `line_item_usage_end_date` The ending timestamp of the line item usage. Used to filter resource usage within a date range  and to aggregate on usage window.

- `line_item_resource_id` An id, also called the provider id, is an id given to line items that are intantiated resources.

- `line_item_line_item_type` The type of the line item, used to determine if the resource usage is covered by a savings plan and has a discounted price.

- `line_item_usage_type` What is being used in the line item, for the purposes of a compute resource this is the type of VM and where it is running

- `line_item_product_code` The service that the line item is from. Used to filter out items not from EC2.

- `reservation_reservation_a_r_n` Amazon Resource Name for reservation of line item, the presense of this value is used to identify a resource as being part of a reservation plan.

- `line_item_unblended_cost` The undiscounted cost of a resource.

- `savings_plan_savings_plan_effective_cost` The cost of a resource discounted by a savings plan

- `reservation_effective_cost` The cost of a resource discounted by a reservation



#### On-Demand/Savings Plan Query
This query is grouped by 6 columns `line_item_usage_start_date`, `line_item_usage_end_date`, `line_item_resource_id`, `line_item_line_item_type`, `line_item_usage_type` and `line_item_product_code`. The columns `line_item_unblended_cost` and `savings_plan_savings_plan_effective_cost` are summed on this grouping. Finally the query filters out rows that are not within a given date range, have a missing `line_item_resource_id` and have a `line_item_product_code` not equal to "AmazonEC2". The grouping as 3 import aspects the timeframe of the line items, the resource as defined by the resource id and the usage type which is later used to determine the proper cost of the resources as it was used.

#### Reservation Query
The reservation query is grouped on 5 columns `line_item_usage_start_date`, `line_item_usage_end_date`, `reservation_reservation_a_r_n`, `line_item_resource_id` and `line_item_product_code`. The query is summed on the `reservation_effective_cost` and filtered by the date window and for missing values in the `reservation_reservation_a_r_n` column.

## Processing Query results

The on-demand Query is categorized into different resource types: compute, network, storage and other. Network is identified by the presence of the "byte" in the line_item_usage_type. Compute and storage are identified by the presence of "i-" and "vol-" prefixes in `line_item_resource_id` respectively. Non compute values are removed from the results. Out of the two costs aggregated by this query the correct one to use is determined by the `line_item_line_item_type`, if it has a value of "SavingsPlanCoveredUsage" then the `savings_plan_savings_plan_effective_cost` is used as the cost if not then the `line_item_unblended_cost` is used.

In the reservation query all of the results are of the compute category and there is only the `reservation_effective_cost` to use as cost

These results are then merged into one set, with the provider id used to associate the cost with other information about the resource.
